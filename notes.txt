Notes:
Getting a React app up and running on your own with Webpack!

So!
------------------------------------------------------------
1. initialize git repository

------------------------------------------------------------
2. initialize npm add .gitignore

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Babel
Babel is needed so you can use JSX to put your React components together in a succinct way. You need a few node packages:
  babel-core
  babel-preset-es2015  (to let Babel work with ES6)
  babel-preset-react  (to let Babel work with React ??)

Also, add a .babelrc file. This configures Babel to use the presets that we just installed.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Webpack
"Webpack bundles all your JavaScript together into a single file. This includes each JavaScript file that you write as well as your npm packages."

Basically, webpack PACKS everything into a single file, that loads more quickly, and is easier to deploy.

As part of this process, you need to add a webpack.config.js file, which will contain six configuration options:
  a. context

  b. entry - the entry point for your application

  c. module.loaders - this section specifies how each file should be processed before it is combined into your bundle. We only have one loader: Babel. This converts ES6 + JSX iJavascript into ES5 before merging it into your bundle.

  d. resolveLoader - This is where Webpack should look for loaders, like the Bable loader mentioned above

  e. resolve - where Webpack should look for files reference by an import or require() statement. This makes it so that you can import npm packages in your code.

so... here are the steps

Run this command:
npm install --save webpack babel-loader

Add these files:
src/main.js
webpack.config.js

NOTE: babel-loader is a Webpack "loader". It supports running Babel from Webpack. Usually any npm package ending in -loader is for Webpack.


------------------------------------------------------------
5. Compile!
Now we get to USE webpack :D
Add an npm script to package.json called 'compile'. This will run Webpack.

We won't actually use compile, but it just shows you how webpack works. In reality, webpack will be run by the Express server. And this leads us nicely into the next part...



------------------------------------------------------------
6. Express

npm install --save express webpack-dev-middleware

THEN in server file, this is how you use webpackConfig and middleware

  var webpackConfig = require('./webpack.config.js');

  var compiler = webpack(webpackConfig);

  app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/www'));

  app.use(webpackDevMiddleware(compiler, {
    hot: true,
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    publicPath: '/',
    stats: {
      colors: true,
    },
    historyApiFallback: true,
  }));

And in your index.html file, load the bundle.js script in the head element:
  <script src="/bundle.js" ></script>


Test that everything works by running npm start.
