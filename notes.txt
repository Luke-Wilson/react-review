Notes:
Getting a React app up and running on your own with Webpack!

So!
1. initialize git repository
2. initialize npm add .gitignore
3. Babel
Babel is needed so you can use JSX to put your React components together in a succinct way. You need a few node packages:
  babel-core
  babel-preset-es2015
  babel-preset-react

Also, add a .babelrc file. This configures Babel to use the presets that we just installed.

4. Webpack
